# CSS Icons
---
Here I'll placed some css icons. For me it would be pleasure to make an icon with any compexity. 
So here is _SCSS_ and _CSS_ file. To run right icon on your server just open ```main.scss``` and add there a line, for example: 
```@import 'c_letter'```
and it will run on you computer, don't forget to compile _SCCS_ to _CSS_ right to ```css/main.css``` file to open it properly.
